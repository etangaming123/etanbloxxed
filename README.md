# >> etanbloxxed <<

mom, can we get bloxstrap?
no, we have bloxstrap at home

(chat gpt was used to make some parts of the script oops)

## [ PLEASE NOTE ]

**etanbloxxed was originally meant to be made for me**, etan, specifically. because of this, **you may experience some unexpected behaviors** when using this script.
**etanbloxxed was made for macos** users because, at the time of writing this, bloxstrap does not support macos.

an ipinfo.io api key is required to see server location, get one at https://ipinfo.io/ (not inputting an api key will disable seeing server location)

the windows version is not tested, use at your own risk!

## [ What's etanbloxxed? ]

etanbloxxed is a **Python script that is ran alongside Roblox**. it will **broadcast your currently playing game to discord**, and will **show you the server location** whenever you join a game (an ipinfo api key is required https://ipinfo.io/)!

this is basically more or less a remake of Bloxstrap's Roblox RPC

## [ How do I use it? ]

download an etanbloxxed script (e.g etanbloxxed_macos.py for macos, etanbloxxed_windows.py for windows), then just run etanbloxxed! etanbloxxed will ask you for settings (ipinfo api key, userid etc.), then, when you run the script, it will automatically run roblox! it's as easy as that!

## [ Help! I have an issue! ]

this is my very first **public** python project, so issues are very likely to occur. create an issue in this repo or something idk

## [ What can I do with this? ]

**Anything**, really! take the code and make it your own, i don't mind!
