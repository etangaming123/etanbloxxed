# etanbloxxed
## PLEASE NOTE:
etanbloxxed was originally meant to be made for me, etan, specifically. because of this, you may experience some unexpected behaviors when using this script. 
etanbloxxed was made for macos users, as, at the time of writing this, bloxstrap does not support macos. 

## What's etanbloxxed?
etanbloxxed is a Python script that is ran alongside Roblox. it will broadcast your currently playing game to discord, and will show you the server location whenever you join a game (an ipinfo api key is required https://ipinfo.io/)!

## How do I use it?
with etanbloxxed downloaded, open roblox, then run etanbloxxed! etanbloxxed will then close when it detects that roblox closes! it's as simple as that!

## Help! I have an issue!
this is my very first **public** python project, so issues are very likely to occur. create an issue in this repo or something idk
