# etanbloxxed

mom, can we get bloxstrap?
no, we have bloxstrap at home

## PLEASE NOTE:

etanbloxxed was originally meant to be made for me, etan, specifically. because of this, you may experience some unexpected behaviors when using this script.
etanbloxxed was made for macos users because, at the time of writing this, bloxstrap does not support macos.

the windows version is not tested, use at your own risk!

## What's etanbloxxed?

etanbloxxed is a Python script that is ran alongside Roblox. it will broadcast your currently playing game to discord, and will show you the server location whenever you join a game (an ipinfo api key is required https://ipinfo.io/)! 

## How do I use it?

just run etanbloxxed! etanbloxxed will ask you for settings (ipinfo api key, userid etc.), then, when you run the script, it will automatically run roblox! it's as easy as that!

## Help! I have an issue!

this is my very first **public** python project, so issues are very likely to occur. create an issue in this repo or something idk

## What can I do with this?
Anything, really! take the code and make it your own, i don't mind!
